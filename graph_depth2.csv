Depth2_1,Depth1_44,"A degree is important but not necessary, often companies also want people that have better work ethics and more work experience instead of academic knowledge.",job,,,
Depth2_2,Depth1_44,I do not think that the number of students will be significantly reduced by paid studies. If someone is determined to study then he will find financial resources for the payment even if he has to find a float or take a loan.,loan,,,
Depth2_3,Depth1_44,"Education is important not only from an individual point of view, but also for society. Everyone should be encouraged to go to university. Maybe student loans need to be reframed to the student saying thank you when they can afford to do so.",afford,loan,,
Depth2_4,Depth1_68,"But what if this person who is given free education is someone who does not have the skills to actually have that profession? And just be, for example, a doctor, because it was given to you for free.",free,,,
Depth2_5,Depth1_68,"There are loans about so no one pays fees up front anyway, only when they have secured a job. ",loan,job,,
Depth2_6,Depth1_68,"When it comes to such students, I think that you can introduce for them some kind of a scholarship, which would compensate for school fees for good results in learning.",scholarship,,,
Depth2_7,Depth1_68,Young people should have access to good careers and FE advice through their schools and colleges.,job,accessible,,
Depth2_8,Depth1_5,"Everyone already has access to higher education by taking the loan, which should not be a problem to repay if the graduate gets a good job",loan,job,accessible,
Depth2_9,Depth1_5,"I agree, better education has a positive impact far beyond better paying jobs. Therefore no one should be discouraged from going to university. Student loans and financial support are available for those who cannot pay upfront.",loan,job,,
Depth2_10,Depth1_5,Better education does not mean it's free. But better education actually leads to better performance and the possibility of better jobs.,job,free,,
Depth2_11,Depth1_60,Sure but then the government will have to enforce taxes in order to sustain the universities,government,tax,,
Depth2_12,Depth1_60,"Why is diversity in the student population worthwhile as an aim in itself, if there is equal opportunity to finance education through student loans.",loan,,,
Depth2_13,Depth1_60,If a student really wants to do a degree in their chosen field they will take on the tuition fee loan or look for other ways to achieve a degree. Maybe the less committed would think twice before pursuing a degree. A degree isn�t for everyone. ,loan,,,
Depth2_14,Depth1_1,"I agree in principle, however, a large proportion of the population will never go to university, therefore it would be unfair to let them pay for it through taxes.",tax,,,
Depth2_15,Depth1_1,"Regardless whether education is a human right or not, making it free will only lower the quality available to everyone. Free education would be wasted on some people. ",free,,,
Depth2_16,Depth1_1,"Education is not a human right. In the UK you receive a free education upto the age of 18, if you choose to remain in education after this you should pay for it. ",free,,,
Depth2_17,Depth1_18,Student loans are a common situation and the banks actually have good contracts with students to help them with this heavy burden at a young age.,loan,,,
Depth2_18,Depth1_18,"They don't have to have the money readily available, since there is an option to take a student loan which you only pay back after graduating when your income exceeds a certain level.",loan,,,
Depth2_19,Depth1_18,"I think student loans are a perfect instrument for that, basically saying ""pay it back when you can"".",loan,,,
Depth2_20,Depth1_23,If you want to go to University this is a financial sacrifice you may have to make. Earnings are likely to be on par once you have a degree and get a job. ,job,,,
Depth2_21,Depth1_23,Those who earn less must have greater help if the intent is to continue. It's Not beneficial for any student to have debts.,debt,,,
Depth2_22,Depth1_23,If they are earning enough to repay the loan they have nothing to worry about it. ,loan,,,
Depth2_23,Depth1_23,"The free market dictates remuneration; when deciding on a non-stem field, students need to take into consideration such aspects.",free,,,
Depth2_24,Depth1_73,"Even if they end up with a debt, it is likely they will have the resource to pay it back, because they will a good job",job,debt,,
Depth2_25,Depth1_73,"Students with high potential to succeed can access a variety of scholarships and the like. Further, there's nothing to stop a prospective student from taking some time to save up the funds.",scholarship,accessible,,
Depth2_26,Depth1_73,"The student fee debt should be repayable only over a certain level of income and it should not contribute to a negative credit record, etc.",debt,,,
Depth2_27,Depth1_17,There are systems in place to assist students in such cases and the loan is not needed to be repaid immediately. ,loan,,,
Depth2_28,Depth1_17,By this logic we also could not make loans to buy a house or a car. There must be priorities. However the rates should be a bit lower.,loan,,,
Depth2_29,Depth1_11,"Not everyone can be a doctor or engineer, there are a lot of other work prospects in other areas",job,,,
Depth2_30,Depth1_11,People who can't afford have government help. Government can't afford free education for all unless they increase the taxes and people won't like it.,afford,government,tax,free
Depth2_31,Depth1_11,"Student loans allow further education for everyone, otherwise the funding would have to come from a graduate tax or a tax on everyone.",tax,loan,,
Depth2_32,Depth1_11,Education has so many different forms so in todays digitalized world it's not true that is not available. Talented students can always make it by applying for scholarships. There are online platforms offering cheap education.,scholarship,,,
Depth2_33,Depth1_11,Everyone should be able to afford tuition fees if they are paid for by readily accessible student loans that are only repaid at an affordable rate over a reasonable threshold of income.,afford,loan,accessible,
Depth2_34,Depth1_6,The loan system is in in place to prevent this happening. All economic groups should factor in loan repayment costs and work out if it is affordable  to go to uni. ,loan,job,,
Depth2_35,Depth1_6,"Not everyone should have a university degree, otherwise who would build houses, work the fields etc. A talented student can have scholarships to get into otherwise expensive universities as well.",scholarship,job,,
Depth2_36,Depth1_6,"Government helps to pay the education for people who can't afford such expenses and fees are too high for people who can't pay, but the cost of a degree to a government is much more higher than 9K.",afford,government,,
Depth2_37,Depth1_6,"That is why loans exist, to equal the playing field so everyone can access university education. The sector has to be funded somehow and people need to value a university education.",loan,accessible,,
Depth2_38,Depth1_9,There are plenty of options for students that can't pay college or can't pay it at the moment. Scholarships or loans are examples of that.,loan,scholarship,,
Depth2_39,Depth1_53,"The high fee can be covered by a student loan which is accessible to everyone and which will not be payable until a certain level of income. Furthermore, such a fee ensures that universities keep their funding and remain active and widely available.",loan,accessible,,
Depth2_40,Depth1_53,It is more widely accessible now than it has ever been. More people go to university now than ever before.,accessible,,,
Depth2_41,Depth1_53,Education should be the responsibility of the state to the magistrate level. And any fees charged on forced internships of educated graduates.,free,,,
Depth2_42,Depth1_66,"It's true that education is essential to better civilisation, but it IS accessible by all those who desire it. Nothing is impossible, there are plenty of options to earn money with a good job or even pay a loan.",loan,job,accessible,
Depth2_43,Depth1_66,"There is the opportunity of scholarships that exceptional students stand out and only students that deserve it, have tuitions for free",scholarship,free,,
Depth2_44,Depth1_66,"Tuition fees don�t make things inaccessible, just make it necessary for people to really consider whether university is right for them and their career path",job,,,
Depth2_45,Depth1_4,"Everyone HAS access to university education due to the student loans that are given to everybody. It should, however, not be for free, hence free university education means increasing taxes for everyone, including those that do not go to university.",tax,loan,accessible,free
Depth2_46,Depth1_4,"Yes, but if people are really good students there are free scholarships for poor people",scholarship,free,,
Depth2_47,Depth1_4,"Concessions should be made for those who are not able to financially afford  university education. However, they must meet certain qualifying criteria first.",afford,,,
Depth2_48,Depth1_4,"Agreed, but poorer students are supported by the loan system which will not cripple them with debt as you only have to pay it back on a certain percentage. ",loan,debt,,
