Depth3_26,Burdening students with a large amount of debt is bad for personal finances across the country and bad for the economy in the long term.,student_finance
Depth3_34,the problem is that there isn't an equal opportunity to finance education through student loans. Those in less fortunate financial situations will still be far less inclined to take out loans.,student_finance
