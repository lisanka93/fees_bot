"if someone decides to go into higher education , the general public should not be expected to pay for it via taxes.",
"because like this students will take the university seriously . if it would be free , it would n't have the same value .",
"the fee is a way of selecting people that really want to get in the better universities and invest in their future .",
"good incentive for students to finish the degree . we see models in several european countries where university is free , and the result is that many either never finish their studies , or take an obscene number of years to finish .",
"fees should be kept as it ensures that only people who really want to attend university do so , if it is free people would take spaces just because it is an easy thing to do",
"most students will be able to claim a student loan to pay the fees . student loans do not count towards debt eg if you are getting a mortgage and they do not have to be paid until the graduate is earning over a certain amount .",
"without the fees universities would have to ask for government funding to run ( not going to happen , and if it did it would impact on other services such as funding for the nhs ) or sponsorship or donations . sponsorship could influence the courses which have to be taught ."
